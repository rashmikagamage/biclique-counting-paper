\textbf{Contributions}. Our key contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We present the first approximation algorithm with formal accuracy guarantees for the $(p,q)$-biclique counting problem.
	\item We propose an innovative edge-oriented technique for refining the sampling space, strategically balancing the computational load between the two stages of the algorithm to optimize overall runtime.
	\item We introduce a novel sampling method that not only ensures accuracy but also allows for dynamic refinement of the sampling process, adapting to the graphâ€™s structure for improved efficiency.
\end{itemize}

These contributions significantly advance the field of biclique counting, offering a practical and efficient approach for large-scale bipartite graph analysis.



\section{Introduction}

%Biclique counting in bipartite graphs, which involves identifying and enumerating complete bipartite subgraphs, is a crucial task in network analysis. Given a bipartite graph \( G = (U, V, E) \) with disjoint vertex sets \( U \) and \( V \), and edge set \( E \subseteq U \times V \), a biclique is defined as a complete bipartite subgraph \( K_{a,b} \), where every vertex in \( U' \subseteq U \) is connected to every vertex in \( V' \subseteq V \). The problem of biclique counting entails determining the number of such \( K_{a,b} \) subgraphs for various values of \( a \) and \( b \).
%
%Bicliques are particularly useful in a variety of applications, including community detection in social networks, motif finding in biological networks, and frequent itemset mining in transaction databases. However, the problem of counting bicliques becomes computationally infeasible for large graphs due to the combinatorial nature of the problem. The number of potential bicliques grows exponentially with the size of the vertex sets, leading to significant challenges in both exact and approximate counting methods.

\subsection{Exact Biclique Counting}
%
%Exact biclique counting algorithms typically rely on exhaustive search methods, which enumerate all possible subsets of vertices and verify the completeness of the subgraph. One classical approach involves iterating over all pairs of subsets \( U' \subseteq U \) and \( V' \subseteq V \), checking whether every vertex in \( U' \) is connected to every vertex in \( V' \). The time complexity of this naive approach is \( O(2^{|U|} \times 2^{|V|}) \), which is infeasible for large graphs.
%
%More sophisticated exact algorithms, such as those based on recursive backtracking and dynamic programming, aim to reduce the search space by exploiting the structural properties of the graph. For instance, algorithms using degeneracy ordering or vertex pruning techniques can significantly reduce the number of candidate subgraphs, improving the practical performance. Despite these improvements, the worst-case time complexity of exact bi clique counting algorithms remains exponential in the size of the graph.

\subsection{Approximation Algorithms}

%Given the computational hardness of exact biclique counting, approximation algorithms have been developed to provide scalable solutions for large graphs.
%
%Another approximation technique involves relaxing the completeness condition of bicliques, allowing the identification of dense bipartite subgraphs that approximate bicliques. These methods leverage techniques from graph clustering and matrix factorization, providing a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.
%
%The time complexity of approximation algorithms varies depending on the specific method employed. For instance, sampling-based methods typically run in \( O(k \times |E|) \), where \( k \) is the number of samples, making them more feasible for large-scale graphs compared to exact algorithms.
